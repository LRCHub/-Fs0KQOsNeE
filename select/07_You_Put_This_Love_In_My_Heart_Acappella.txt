I found it hard to believe someone like you cared for me
You put this love in my heart
I tried but could not refuse, you gave me no time to lose
You put this love in my heart

I want to know where the bad feelings go (feelings go)
When I'm depressed and I get down so low
And then I see you coming to me and it's alright (it's alright)

I want to tell you right now, I'm not afraid to say how
You put this love in my heart.
There are sometimes when I doubt, but you always find me out
You put this love in my heart

Cause when I see all that you've done for me (done for me)
It's hard to doubt, I just have to believe
Cause you followed up, proven all your love

Well I know the loneliness I had before (oh I had before),
Is gone now, I'll never feel it anymore,
Cause your love has released me from all that's in my past,
And I know I can believe you,
When you say I'll never be forsaken, Your love is gonna last (gotta believe your love, it will last)

There's so much more I could say, if I could just find a way
You put this love in my heart
Is this real or a dream, I feel so good I could scream
You put this love in my heart.

I want to know where the bad feelings go (feelings go)
When I'm depressed and I get down so low
And then I see you coming to me and it's alright (it's alright)

You put this love in my heart
You put this love in my heart, yeah, you put this love in my heart (repeat and fade)
