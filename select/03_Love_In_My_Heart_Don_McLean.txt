Well there's food on the table and love in the heart
And a real good woman and a couple of kids
And a dog that thinks I'm smart
I got a big old mortgage on a little old house
And car that'll sometimes start
But there's food on the table and love in the heart

Oh, the roof is leaking but I care not
Gather those buckets pans and pots
Carry 'em throw 'em in the sink a lot
I turn the heat up higher

I don't have much that didn't come free
Bills eat up my salary
But I can still hang goodies on a Christmas tree
And sing by crackling fire

And there's food on the table and love in the heart
And a real good woman and a couple of kids
And a dog that thinks I'm smart
I got a big old mortgage on a little old house
And car that'll sometimes start
But there's food on the table and love in the heart

Well I don't have money but I sure ain't poor
Many a rich man still wants more
Sooner or later he buys the store
And he still ain't satisfied

It never took much to make me smile
A new pair of jeans to keep in style
And a little bit of loving every once in a while
To stroke my foolish pride

And some food on the table and love in the heart
And a real good woman to call me honey
And to hold me in the dark
Oh, the winds may howl and the roof cave in
And the world may fall apart
But there's food on the table and love in the heart

Food on the table and love in the heart
And a real good woman and a couple of kids
And a dog that thinks I'm smart
I got a big old mortgage on a little old house
And car that'll sometimes start
But there's food on the table and love in the heart
Food on the table and love in the heart
