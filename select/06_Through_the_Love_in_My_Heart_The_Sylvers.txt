Love is like a bond. Wonder like you have never known, baby.
It doesn't sway or falter. It's as strong as a wall of stone.
When I look in your eyes, it's as though I've been given a gift
And darling you must understand that
I'll never be happy until I know that,

Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you
Through the love in my heart The light is meant for me and you
Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you.
Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you.

Now you've had your say,
And the only way for me to show you how I feel about you baby.
Is to be with you night and day,
And by then we can determine we are truly meant for each other,
Cause when I look in your eyes it's as though I've been given a gift,
And darling you must understand that
I'll never be happy until I know that,

Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you
Through the love in my heart The light is meant for me and you
Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you.
Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you.

And because of your happiness,
How can I guess to express my love and time
After time I can tell you myself that you're mine.

Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you
Through the love in my heart The light is meant for me and you
Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you.
Through the love of my heart The light is meant for me and you.
